(version |release|)

val3dity---pronounced 'val-three-dity'---allows us to validate 3D primitives according to the international standard ISO19107.
Think of it as `PostGIS ST_IsValid  <http://postgis.net/docs/ST_IsValid.html>`_, but for 3D primitives.

In short, it verifies whether a 3D primitive respects the definition as given in `ISO19107 <https://www.iso.org/standard/66175.html>`_ and GML/CityGML.
The validation of the following 3D primitives is fully supported:

  - ``MultiSurface``
  - ``CompositeSurface`` 
  - ``Solid``
  - ``MultiSolid``
  - ``CompositeSolid``

Unlike many other validation tools in 3D GIS, inner rings in polygons/surfaces are supported and so are cavities in solids (also called voids or inner shells).

However, as is the case for many formats used in practice, only planar and linear primitives are allowed: no curves or spheres or other parametrically-modelled primitives are supported. 
There is no plan to support these geometries.

val3dity accepts as input:

  - `CityJSON <http://www.cityjson.org>`_
  - `CityJSON Sequences (CityJSONSeq) <https://www.cityjson.org/cityjsonseq/>`_
  - `tu3djson <https://github.com/tudelft3d/tu3djson>`_
  - `JSON-FG (OGC Features and Geometries JSON) <https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json>`_
  - `OBJ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file>`_ 
  - `OFF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFF_(file_format)>`_
  - `IndoorGML <http://indoorgml.net/>`_

For the CityJSON and IndoorGML formats, extra validations (specific to the format) are performed, eg the overlap between different parts of a building, or the validation of the navigation graph in IndoorGML.
